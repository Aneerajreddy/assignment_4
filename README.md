1. Apply Linear Regression to the provided dataset using underlying steps.

a. Import the given “Salary_Data.csv”

 
b. Split the data in train_test partitions, such that 1/3 of the data is reserved as test subset.
c. Train and predict the model.
d. Calculate the mean_squared error

 
e. Visualize both train and test data using scatter plot.
 

2. Apply K means clustering in the dataset provided:
• Remove any null values by the mean.
 
• Use the elbow method to find a good number of clusters with the K-Means algorithm
• Calculate the silhouette score for the above clustering
 

3. Try feature scaling and then apply K-Means on the scaled features. Did that improve the Silhouette score? If
Yes, can you justify why 
 
Silhouette score before applying scaling: 0.464450664591727


Silhouette score after applying scaling: 0.1976074492720698
